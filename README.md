# CircuitsBook
I'm writing a circuits textbook, this is to keep track of changes, updates I want to make, etc. before it goes live. The idea is my students can see what changes have occurred since the last time they downloaded the text (because it is not always clear). I'm new to GitHub but I assume it's better for keeping track of errors, changes, and improvements than Google Drive.
